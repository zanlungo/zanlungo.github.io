Application names and window titles are nonimal variables. In order to make their processing easier, I give an integer code for each possible values. 
In addition, also the task names are coded as integers. Please see below files for the codes.


For exe (i.e. application name) codes, see codes_exe.txt
For window title codes, see codes_title.txt
For task codes, see codes_task.txt
